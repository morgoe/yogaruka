The bottom line of yoga is thorough mind-body balance, thus yoga at your office is guaranteed to increase creativity and productivity, decrease stress levels, reduce absenteeism, improve health and wellbeing, help employees that work long hours maintain focus and high performance levels.

YogaRuka offers single and 12-class packages for your employees to enjoy yoga in the comfort and convenience of the workplace. We bring you all the props, and at request, the mats.

Facilitated by any of our teachers, in function of the required class typology. For very large teams (20+ people) please request a quote, since two teachers might need to be dispatched.
