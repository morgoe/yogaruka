Our Russell Lea sanctuary was the first studio in Australia to be <strong>fully sustainable</strong>. We aspire to have the smallest possible environmental footprint so, from the 100% biodegradable mats to the organic cotton bolsters and straps, to rice husk bricks, to the resin used for the restoration of the flooring, everything has been done to honour the health of you and the Earth.

This studio is the first Australian yoga studio in a restored church. The building dates back to 1942 and is an architectural treasure, providing plenty of space and beautiful light to enhance any practice.

The YogaRuka studios, located in Russell Lea, brings together many different styles of movement to help you feel great in your body.

Our approach to teaching is unique: we combine various yoga lineages with aspects of [Stretch Therapy™](https://stretchtherapy.net/), a <strong>focused movement</strong> framework, <strong>functional training</strong>, <strong>Pilates</strong>, Yoga Therapy and other contemporary methods of mobility. 

Owner and founder, Rua, has found that this multidisciplinary approach when it comes to moving our body works best for people living the modern Western lifestyle. Rua and her team of teachers know that the purpose of yoga and movement is not just to make a shape with one’s body. Yoga and movement are about acquiring long term strength, endurance and flexibility, and recovering or enhancing one's overall fitness and mental balance. 

Our sanctuary is the first studio in Australia to be <strong>fully sustainable</strong>. We aspire to have the smallest possible environmental footprint so, from the 100% biodegradable mats to the organic cotton bolsters and straps, to rice husk bricks, to the resin used for the restoration of the flooring, everything has been done to honour the health of you and the Earth.

Our space is unique in that it is the first Australian yoga studio in a restored church. The building dates back to 1942 and is an architectural treasure, providing plenty of space and beautiful light to enhance any practice.

YogaRuka is a community focused studio. We want you to feel at home in our space and to make it yours. Anyone is welcome who wants to share their interest in healthy and conscious movement, and living.
