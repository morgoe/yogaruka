At YogaRuka, we recommend starting your personal practice with a private session.

Private sessions are a great way to work on your yoga practice and improve your overall health and mobility. They complement any regular asana or mobility practice. They are also a place for beginner’s or those working with one or many health problems.

You and your teacher will discuss the regularity of your private sessions, as well as how often you might like to come to group classes.

Each session is tailored to your specific needs so that when you go into a group class you know exactly what to do based on your body and unique needs.

All private sessions begin with a full anatomical assessment. Private sessions may include any of the following practices or modalities:

- Hatha/Vinyasa
- Stretch Therapy
- Yoga Therapy
- Breathing techniques (Pranayama)
- Mindfulness and Meditation
- Relaxation

Private sessions can be held at YogaRuka (during times when group classes are not in session) or on Zoom.

Before each private session you will be able to discuss with your teacher its format, any injuries you are working with, whether or not you would like hands on assists or prefer verbal cueing. There is also the option to discuss the best diet for your constitution and current state of health.

We are also able to do private sessions for kids and people living with disabilities.

Facilitated by our teachers in their area of expertise, these sessions can also be given in languages other than English (at the moment - Italian and French).
