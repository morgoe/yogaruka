**Learn to get out of your head and into your body by integrating and expressing your emotions in this group retreat.** This retreat is for you if:

- You struggle to balance feeling your emotions without letting them control you, and end up either repressing or reacting
- You spend a lot of time in your head, and want to learn to spend more time in your body
- You have difficulty connect deeply with people

**We‚Äôll learn embodiment:**

- Feel like you are your whole body, not just a mind controlling a ‚Äúmeatsuit‚Äù
- Identify and let go of unconscious tension, allowing grace and ease of movement

**We‚Äôll work with emotions:**

- Identify *and let go of* the emotions and stories driving your behaviour
- Practise healthy ways to express and release emotions, to avoid falling into fight/flight/freeze/fawn responses
- Learn to better perceive emotions in others, helping you to connect more deeply in your relationships
