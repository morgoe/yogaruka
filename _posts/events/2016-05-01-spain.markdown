					<p>Do good to your spirit and good to the planet by joining this one of a kind retreat in the midst of the Natural Reserve Sierra de Grazalema in the Mountains of Cádiz.</p>

					<p>A <strong>Unesco Biosphere reserve</strong> since 1977, it is Andalucia's first natural park and among Spain's most ecologically outstanding areas with its limestone cliffs, gullies, caves and gorges, its hundreds of endemic Mediterranean plant species and griffon vulture colonies. In fact it's been included amongst the 50 natural wonders of the world ahead of places as famous as the Grand Canyon in the US!</p>

					<p>Spend one week with us to <strong>take your practice to a new level</strong>: improve your poses and posture, make friends in a healthy, cooperative and non-judgemental environment and explore a part of the world filled with marvels still untouched.</p>

					<p>If you were already considering taking a step back to basics in order to discover and work with your body’s strengths and weaknesses, this retreat will stretch your body but also your mind. Part of all profits goes back to Nature Conservancy.</p>

					<p>The estate is 4 kilometres from the town El Gastor, known as the balcony of the The White Villages of Cádiz, due to its altitude. The property is on <strong>250,000 square meters of land</strong> protected by automated security gates.</p>

					</figure>

					<p>There are 5 clusters of country homes that are separated from each other by large distances to ensure privacy. Each of them has <strong>its own private pool</strong> with incredible views of the mountains.</p>
					
					<p>There is a tennis court surrounded by trees and free parking at the homes. Yoga classes will be held in a spacious room bathed in sunlight. The yoga shala is equipped with mats and props for all our yoga needs. The meals will be served in the big house.</p>

					<h3 class="m-accordion-contentTitle">FAQs</h3>

					<ul class="faqs">
						<li class="faqs-question">Are activities included in the yoga retreat?</li>

						<li class="faqs-question">How can I get to the yoga retreat?</li>
						<li class="faqs-answer">The best option is to rent a car from the airport for your entire stay. It´s cheaper than a taxi and that way you can enjoy the freedom of transportation every day on the retreat.</li>

						<li class="faqs-question">I need a special diet, can you provide it?</li>

						<li class="faqs-question">Are cancellations allowed?</li>
						<li class="faqs-answer">You can cancel your reservation up to 60 days before the retreat. If you cancel after the allotted time period you'll lose the deposit or you can transfer it to another guest.</li>

		<h2>Teachers</h2>
		
		<h3>Rua</h3>

		<figure class="u-pull-right image-small">
			<img src="/assets/images/about/rua.jpg">
		</figure>

		<p>Rua is a rather nerdy yogini and has been intermittently flirting with yoga for almost a decade, until she decided to fully dedicate herself to it in 2014. Nowadays she is striving to teach yoga the way she would have always wanted to be taught.</p>

		<p>Her long-term goal is to gather a new generation of yoga practitioners who think of yoga critically, not superstitiously, who want to learn to work healthily and integrate balance and sustainability in their lives; to offer a resource for those who want to approach yoga but also for those who simply want to understand yoga without practicing it; to offer a space for those who have tried and failed to get into it many times before, to try once more.</p>

		<p>Despite exposing herself to many styles along the years (Yin, Iyengar, Ashtanga Vinyasa, a.s.o) for Rua the one size fits all approach won’t do. “Adapting yoga to suit the needs of every unique individual is where the true greatness of yoga lies” as TKV Desikachar had put it, and it’s how her classes inevitably develop.</p>

		<h3>Karen</h3>

		<figure class="u-pull-right image-small">
			<img src="/assets/images/about/karen.jpg">
		</figure>

		<p>Karen loves a challenge and, since she’d always excelled at all sports she’d tried, soccer included, yoga came as a natural progression. However surprisingly, or perhaps not so surprisingly, she discovered herself initially to be unprepared for yoga. She wasn’t as bendy as she’d thought, in body or mind.</p>

		<p>Gradually though, yoga brought her in touch with her own body in a way unlike anything she’d experienced before, made her more mindful, more aware of her thoughts, actions and emotions, and less competitive. Yoga has taught her to not compare herself with others, but rather to celebrate everyone’s differences.</p>

		<p>Today her biggest passion is to share the gift of yoga, linking Breath and Movement with Intention. She sees yoga as a way of life — something to practice both on and off the mat. She also loves to share her delicious smoothie and raw vegan cake recipes to infuse more energy and fun into the after practice.</p>

		<p>Karen will lead Vinyasa flow and Rua will lead most Hatha and Yin, however both will be present to all classes for your extra support and assistance.</p>

	<section id="jumpTo-philosophy">
		<h3>Our Philosophy</h3>

		<p>Whether doing yoga asana or other types of physical exercise, or even only sitting, postural alignment is crucial, a lot of issues originate in it, so a lot of focus will be placed on it during our classes. Yoga is however not just asana, therefore our retreat will provide an overview of all the 8 limbs of yoga.</p>

		<img class="m-doubleExposure" src="/assets/images/retreats/double-exposure.jpg">

		<h3 class="u-text-right">What makes us unique?</h3>

		<ul class="u-pull-right list-bullets">
			<li>You’ll get to dip a toe or two into Hatha, Vinyasa, Yin and Iyengar yoga, as well as Pranayama and various Meditation techniques.</li>
			<li>Small groups of up to 16 people and two teachers present, to keep it intimate and ensure you get lots of individual attention and support.</li> 
			<li>3 vegetarian meals/day, made from local Mediterranean ingredients, are always a win.</li>
			<li>You can opt for an additional individual yoga session outside of the group session times, to help construct your ideal, personalised practice or...</li>
			<li>..you can just hike in the mountains, exploring this unbelievable habitat, swim in the pool, play tennis, ride on horseback.</li>
			<li>Yoga Ruka commits to donate a <strong>minimum of 10% of the profit</strong> from their retreats to support environment, education and environmental education.</li>
