March and April are Endometriosis and Adenomyosis awareness months, and we have a special treat for women who are battling with these chronic illnesses, and others.

This mini-workshop is built around the "spoonie" theory, which suggests that people with chronic illnesses (dubbed "spoonies") have a limited amount of energy - or "spoons" - to use each day. This theory emphasizes the importance of conserving and using energy wisely, as well as prioritizing self-care.

For women, the pelvis and reproductive organs hold a significant amount of emotional energy, metaphysically representing their identity and sense of self in all phases of life. Losing this sense of self is linked somatically to various issues, including:

- High levels of anxiety and hypervigilance
- Constant states of arousal and stress
- IBS and other digestive concerns
- Hypertonic pelvic floor
- Tight psoas
- Sleep issues
- General unhappiness and malaise

The session will teach you to listen to the soft whispers of your body, celebrating the story held in every inch of your being. You'll experience an incredible sensation of "coming home" to your body, and what you once saw as limits will now become opportunities. By engaging with your body's sensations, you'll activate a different part of your brain that often shuts down in response to stress and pain.

Learning to activate this delicate pathway takes time and daily devotion. This event is a taster to give you an idea of the amazing benefits of this focused practice. Regular weekly sessions will be held in small groups, thereafter,  and every level of fitness is welcome.
