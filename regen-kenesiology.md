#### How can re:gen kinesiology help me?

As a kinesiologist, I use muscle testing to tap into the subconscious mind to help identify a specific goal or intention for the session and to determine the emotional and metaphysical connection to the physical symptoms, such as pain, stress, anxiety, dis-ease or even emotional stressors and allow you to feel, process, and release the emotions blocking the body, mind and soul from naturally healing itself.

#### Kinesiology assists with:

- De-activating and releasing self-sabotage programs, limiting belief systems, old stories, patterns, behaviours and attitudes
- Clearing emotional stressors and triggers
- Let go and release old stuck emotions and hurt
- More clarity, clearer mind and focus
- Energy levels & vitality – fatigue, tiredness, motivation
- Self Esteem, self image and self confidence
- Relationship stress, conflict and disharmony
- Money blocks & attracting financial abundance... and so much more.

#### How can the imbalances, stress or pain be cleared?

I use a variety of powerful kinesiology balancing techniques and healing remedies as part of the balance. Remedies can include the following:

- Acupressure points
- Neuro-lympathic massage
- Chakra balancing
- Crystal therapy
- Essential Oils
- Sound and vibrational therapy
- Colour therapy
- Affirmations
- Goals
- Energy healing
- Vibrational Essences
- Nutritional support
-  Lifestyle adjustments...
