### A therapy room in Sydney’s first sustainable wellness centre

We are over the moon to announce that YogaRuka is opening doors to more collaborations! 

Our multi-disciplinary movement studio in the Inner West, dubbed the "Most Eco-Aware Yoga Studio in Australia" by the Yoga Lunchbox (NZ), that at the moment is also hosting the Drummoyne Skin & Body Clinic, is ready to take more health&wellness practitioners on board towards turning into a Holistic Wellness centre.  

We want to foster an environment of empowerment and inclusive participation, healing and growth, where the best of Western science and traditional knowledge come together. Our present movement teachers and our myo-fascial specialist and massage therapist are amongst the best in their fields. We have helped heal many hundreds of people and we intend to continue to do so through a world-class team.

### Perfect for a physical or psychological therapist

Are you an experienced physiotherapist, exercise physiologist, osteopath or chiropractor, guidance counsellor, psychologist or psychotherapist, occupational therapist, speech pathologist - or really any other Allied health professional?

Are you offering a personalised service of unique flavour and do you have solid reviews? Maybe you’ve worked for others but now are ready to become your own boss?
