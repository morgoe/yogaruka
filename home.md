        <p>Injuries, lack of flexibility, a lack of strength—these things aren’t signs there’s something <em>wrong</em> with your body. They’re signs you’ve disconnected from it.</p>
        <p>At Yogaruka, we help you reconnect with your body. The rest comes naturally.</p>

But for most people, this is exactly the problem. Movement so often feels like a chore. When moving is enjoyable, something you’d prefer to do, rather than sit around, strength is inevitable." tile2_image="/assets/images/home/flexibility.jpg" tile2_title="Flexibility" tile2_caption="Your body feels tight because aecenas sed diam eget risus varius blandit sit amet non magna.

Flexibility comes when that trust is rebuilt." tile3_image="/assets/images/home/freedom.jpg" tile3_title="Freedom from injuries" tile3_caption="Injuries happen when we’re disconnected from our body, and rushing to achieve some arbitrary goal. Freedom from injuries comes from letting go of expectations, and engaging with your body in the moment. This also happens to be much more fun." %}
