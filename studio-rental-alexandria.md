### Studio rental in Sydney’s first sustainable wellness centre

We are over the moon to announce that Yogaruka is opening doors to more collaborations! 

Our multidisciplinary movement studios in the Inner West, dubbed the "Most Eco-Aware Yoga Studio in Australia" by the Yoga Lunchbox (NZ), are opening slots on the schedule to take more health and wellness practitioners on board.  

We want to foster an environment of empowerment and inclusive participation, healing and growth, where the best of Western science and traditional knowledge come together. Our present movement specialists, our myo-fascial massage therapist and our kinesiologist are amongst the best in their fields. We have helped heal many hundreds of people and we intend to continue to do so through a world-class team.

### Perfect for PT's, yoga therapists, Pilates instructors, and other movement specialists

Are you an experienced Pilates teacher, yoga teacher or yoga therapist, exercise physiologist?

Are you offering a personalised service of unique flavour and do you have solid reviews? Maybe you’ve worked for others but now are ready to become your own boss?
