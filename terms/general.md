YogaRuka provides group and private mixed movement sessions (fusions of yoga, mobility, calisthenics, Stretch Therapy™, contemporary Pilates, etc) taught by some of the most highly trained teachers in Sydney that have come together under the umbrella of this gorgeous, ecological, holistic fitness space. 


### Changes

YogaRuka reserves the right to cancel, change or vary classes, teachers, workshops or teacher training programs. While we endeavour to give you as much notice as we can, this may not always be possible. Please regularly check live timetables for up-to-date information on all classes and events. YogaRuka also reserves the right to reasonably adjust pricing of class passes and expiry brackets, giving reasonable notice by email. If you have unsubscribed from our mailing list, please regularly check our website for updates. 


### Online Bookings

You are welcome to pre-book online for all of our classes, and this is highly recommended at peak times. If you are unable to attend you must cancel online at least 4 hours prior. Failure to cancel or “no-show” will result in you being charged for the pre-booked class.

If you have pre-booked a class, you must still check in upon arrival so that we know you’ve arrived. Please arrive at least 5 minutes prior to the commencement of class so you can claim your spot on the mat and get in the zone.


### Late-Arrivals & Leaving Class Early

Late arrivals for the are classes are accepted if you can be on the mat in a quiet and respectful manner within the first 5 minutes of the class.

Should you need to leave class early please alert the teacher and make sure you leave as quietly as possible in order to not disturb other students. We understand you may occasionally need to leave class early but if this is a regular pattern we suggest you sign into a class you know you can fully commit to.


### Memberships

All our memberships - online and in-person - are charged monthly, for the one month ahead. 

Unlimited Membership Contract: 
- You will be expected to continue payments until the end of the minimum contract. However, should you need to **cancel** or **downgrade** this agreement within the 3 months, please be aware there will be a $150 cancellation processing fee. Upgrading (e.g., passing from the online to the in-person unlimited) will not incur any fees but it will restart the contract period. 

- If you wish to cancel, suspend or alter your UMC payment in any way you must give YogaRuka a two weeks' notice via email.

- Your payments will continue to draw from your account indefinitely. If you wish us to stop payments at the end of your contract you must inform us **a fortnight** before the termination date. 

- A minimum of one full billing period (30 days) must be completed prior to the cancellation taking effect. Membership cancellations cannot be applied retroactively. 


### Class Passes

All passes are non-refundable, non-transferrable and cannot be exchanged for any other pass. Passes purchased online will activate upon your first visit.

Introductory 2-Week unlimited Passes are a one-time offer to all new attendees at YogaRuka. No other offer or discount can, under any circumstance, be used together with it unless priorly agreed with YogaRuka.

Drop in passes are valid for one month from purchase, and can be used for one visit. All our multi-class passes are valid now for 3 months from activation.

Discounted passes may have different conditions to the above so make sure to check with Reception or the teacher to confirm conditions before purchase.


### Suspensions

If you are on an Auto-Membership, you are welcome to hold or suspend your membership for holiday or business travels, or if you are unable to practice due to serious illness or injury. A two weeks' notice in writing prior to the suspension date is required. Membership suspensions cannot be applied retroactively. **Minimum suspension period for memberships is 7 days. Maximum suspension period is 21 days per 3 months membership period, for a total of 84 days per year**. Please note that we do not allow suspended memberships to be cancelled. One billing period (30 days) must be completed after suspension and prior to cancelling membership.

Class passes cannot be suspended or cancelled under any circumstance.

For all membership enquiries, suspensions and cancellations, please email us at studio@yogaruka.com.


### Concession Passes

Concessions are available for kids and students only. If you purchase online, a valid ID must still be sighted when you come to class. At failure to do so we reserve the right to ask you to pay the difference toward a full membership or pass, or limit the number of days/classes on it. If you are a minor, your guardian will have to co-sign your intake form.

Concession memberships reflect the same conditions as standard memberships (see above).


### Private Yoga Classes

For all private classes we have a strict 24-hour cancellation policy. If you do not cancel via phone or email or change your appointment within 24 hours, or if you do not attend your session, you will be charged the full fee.

Bringing extra participants to your private session will incur an extra of 25% per person to the total. (Practically, a private class for two will cost 1,25 times more than a private class for one. A private class for three will cost 1,56 times more than a private class for one. A private class for four will cost 1,95 times more.)

All private classes that are taken as 10-class passes are subject to the same conditions as the group class passes: they are 3 months valid; as they present a significant discount on the single, they can under no circumstance be refunded, nor can they be transferred or exchanged.


### Intake Forms 

We ask all our first-timers to fill in an intake form that will gather detailed information in regards to your residence, points of contact (incl. GP of choice), age, and medical history. We commit to keep anything pertaining to you that you have communicated to us orally and in writing confidential, however refraining from giving us the requested information may result in us refusing your participation to Exercise.
