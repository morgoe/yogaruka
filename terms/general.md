Yogaruka Studios provide group and private mixed movement sessions (fusions of yoga, mobility, Qigong, calisthenics, Stretch Therapy™, contemporary Pilates, etc) taught by some of the most highly trained teachers in Sydney that have come together under the umbrella of these gorgeous, ecological, holistic fitness spaces. 


### Changes

Yogaruka reserves the right to cancel, change or vary sessions, teachers, workshops or teacher training programs. While we endeavour to give you as much notice as we can, this may not always be possible. Please regularly check live timetables for up-to-date information on all sessions and events. Yogaruka also reserves the right to reasonably adjust pricing of class passes and expiry brackets, giving reasonable notice by email. If you have unsubscribed from our mailing list, please resubscribe, alternatively regularly check our website for updates. 


### Online Bookings

You are welcome to pre-book online for all of our sessions, and this is highly recommended at peak times. If you are unable to attend you must cancel online at least 3 hours prior. Failure to cancel or “no-show” will result in you being charged for the pre-booked class.

If you have pre-booked a class, you must still check in upon arrival so that we know you’ve arrived. Please arrive at least 5 minutes prior to the commencement of the session so you can claim your spot on the mat and get in the zone.


### Late-Arrivals & Leaving a Session Early

A late arrival is accepted if you can be on the mat in a quiet and respectful manner within the first 5 minutes of the session.

Should you need to leave the session early please alert the teacher and make sure you leave as quietly as possible in order to not disturb other students. We understand you may occasionally need to leave the session early but if this is a regular pattern we suggest you sign into a session you know you can fully commit to.


### Memberships

All our memberships - online and in-person - are charged monthly, for the one month ahead and they are three month minimum memberships. You will be expected to continue payments indefinitely until written notice of cancellation is given, and you have **our confirmation in writing**. 

Membership Contract (MC) Conditions: 
- Purchasing a membership contract of any sort through Yogaruka Pty Ltd means that you are entering a legally binding contract. 

- If you wish to cancel, suspend or alter your MC payment in any way you are under contractual obligation to give Yogaruka a minimum two weeks' notice via email, and wait for **our confirmation in writing**. 

- Changes cannot be done automatically on your booking profile. Either upgrading or downgrading (e.g., passing from the online to the in-person, or the other way around) will restart the three-month minimum period. 

- Your payments will continue to draw from your account indefinitely. If you wish us to stop payments at the end of your monthly cycle you must inform us **a fortnight** before the termination date, and wait for **our confirmation in writing**. 

- A minimum of three full billing periods (90 days) must be completed prior to the cancellation taking effect.

- Membership cancellations cannot be applied retroactively under any circumstance. 

- You will be expected to fill in an **exit interview** as a condition to the cancellation. 

- Conditions for putting the membership on hold are listed in the **Suspensions** section.


### Class Passes

All passes are non-refundable, non-transferrable and cannot be exchanged for any other pass. Passes purchased online will activate upon your first visit.

Introductory 2-Week unlimited Passes are a one-time offer to all new attendees at Yogaruka. No other offer or discount can, under any circumstance, be used together with it unless priorly agreed with Yogaruka.

- Drop in passes are valid for one month from purchase, and can be used for one visit.
- Our 5-session passes are valid for 2 months from activation.
- Our 10-session passes are valid for 4 months from activation.

Discounted passes may have different conditions to the above so make sure to check with Reception or the teacher to confirm conditions before purchase.


### Suspensions

If you are on an Auto-Membership, you are welcome to hold or suspend your membership for holiday or business travels, or if you are unable to practice due to serious illness or injury. 
- A two weeks' notice in writing prior to the suspension date is required. Membership suspensions cannot be applied retroactively. 
- **Minimum suspension period for any and all memberships is 14 days. Maximum suspension period is 21 days per 4 months membership period, for a total of 63 days per year**. 
- Please note that we do not allow suspended memberships to be cancelled. One billing period (30 days) must be completed after suspension and prior to cancelling membership, even if the 90-day minimum length of the membership has passed. 
- In the same fashion we do not allow for memberships to be downgraded and then suspended within the same billing period (30 days).

Class passes cannot be suspended or cancelled under any circumstances.

For all membership enquiries, suspensions and cancellations, please email us at studio@yogaruka.com.


### Concession Passes

Concessions are available for kids and students only. If you purchase online, a valid ID must still be sighted when you come to class. At failure to do so we reserve the right to ask you to pay the difference toward a full membership or pass, or limit the number of days/iterations on it. If you are a minor, your guardian will have to co-sign your intake form.

Concession memberships reflect the same conditions as standard memberships (see above).


### Private Movement Sessions

For all private sessions we have a strict 24-hour cancellation policy. If you do not cancel via phone or email or change your appointment within 24 hours, or if you do not attend your session, you will be charged the full fee.

Bringing extra participants to your private session will incur an extra of 25% per person to the total. (Practically, a private class for two will cost 1,25 times more than a private class for one. A private class for three will cost 1,56 times more than a private class for one. A private class for four will cost 1,95 times more.)

All private sessions that are taken as 10-class passes are subject to the same conditions as the group class passes: they are 6 months valid; as they present a significant discount on the single, they can under no circumstance be refunded, nor can they be transferred or exchanged.


### Intake Forms 

We ask all our first-timers to fill in an intake form that will gather detailed information in regards to your residence, points of contact (incl. GP of choice), age, and medical history. We commit to keep anything pertaining to you that you have communicated to us orally and in writing confidential, however refraining from giving us the requested information may result in us refusing your participation to Exercise.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION - ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER. PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON HOW CLAIMS YOU AND WE HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED: In the event that there is a dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Us, or any other third-party service provider, including Autopilot, acting on Our behalf to transmit the mobile messages within the scope of the Program, arising out of or relating to federal or state statutory claims, common law claims, this Agreement, or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, such dispute, claim, or controversy will be, to the fullest extent permitted by law, determined by arbitration in 289 Lyons Rd, Russell Lea NSW 2046, Australia before one arbitrator.

The parties agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in effect. Except as otherwise provided herein, the arbitrator shall apply the substantive laws of the Federal Judicial Circuit in which Yogaruka’s principal place of business is located, without regard to its conflict of laws rules. Within ten (10) calendar days after the arbitration demand is served upon a party, the parties must jointly select an arbitrator with at least five years’ experience in that capacity and who has knowledge of and experience with the subject matter of the dispute. If the parties do not agree on an arbitrator within ten (10) calendar days, a party may petition the AAA to appoint an arbitrator, who must satisfy the same experience requirement. In the event of a dispute, the arbitrator shall decide the enforceability and interpretation of this arbitration agreement in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”). The parties also agree that the AAA’s rules governing Emergency Measures of Protection shall apply in lieu of seeking emergency injunctive relief from a court. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding, and no party shall have rights of appeal except for those provided in section 10 of the FAA. Each party shall bear its share of the fees paid for the arbitrator and the administration of the arbitration; however, the arbitrator shall have the power to order one party to pay all or any portion of such fees as part of a well-reasoned decision. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have the authority to award attorneys’ fees only to the extent expressly authorized by statute or contract. The arbitrator shall have no authority to award punitive damages and each party hereby waives any right to seek or recover punitive damages with respect to any dispute resolved by arbitration. The parties agree to arbitrate solely on an individual basis, and this agreement does not permit class arbitration or any claims brought as a plaintiff or class member in any class or representative arbitration proceeding. Except as may be required by law, neither a party nor the arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration without the prior written consent of both parties, unless to protect or pursue a legal right. If any term or provision of this Section is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this Section or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. If for any reason a dispute proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the parties hereby waive any right to a jury trial. This arbitration provision shall survive any cancellation or termination of your agreement to participate in any of our Programs.

Miscellaneous: You warrant and represent to Us that you have all necessary rights, power, and authority to agree to these Terms and perform your obligations hereunder, and nothing contained in this Agreement or in the performance of such obligations will place you in breach of any other contract or obligation. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein will not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. Any new features, changes, updates or improvements of the Program shall be subject to this Agreement unless explicitly stated otherwise in writing. We reserve the right to change this Agreement from time to time. Any updates to this Agreement shall be communicated to you. You acknowledge your responsibility to review this Agreement from time to time and to be aware of any such changes. By continuing to participate in the Program after any such changes, you accept this Agreement, as modified.
