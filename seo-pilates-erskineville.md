      <h2>5 years of 5 star reviews.</h2>

        <p>Since 2017, Yogaruka has been helping residents of Russell Lea achieve better movement through a better relationship with their bodies, building exceptional strength and flexibility. In 5 years, we’ve received nothing but 5 star reviews on Google Maps.</p>

        <p>On the back of this success, we launched our second location near Erskineville in 2022. We’re bringing the same great teachers, and the same great movement, to this new studio. We can’t wait to see you there.</p>
        
        {% include components/testimonial.html inline=true name="Marie Nicolas" text="Great studio. Very considerate instructors who are clearly experienced, competent and relaxed. Haven’t done yoga in years, but I have been well supported and felt comfortable and capable, whilst also being challenged! Highly recommend." %}
