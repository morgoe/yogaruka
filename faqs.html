      <div class="accordion-body" markdown="1">
        Try everything! We offer so much more variety than most studios. Even if you’re a very experienced yogi, you’ll certainly find something novel here to challenge and excite you. Plus, you never know which style or teacher will resonate with you the most. So sample the lot!

      </h5>
      <div class="accordion-body" markdown="1">
        - A water bottle: Hydration is key!
          - A light (‘ish) stomach: If you’ve had a lot to eat shortly beforehand, you may find some of the movements uncomfortable
            - Clothes you can sweat and move in comfortably: We highly recommend natural fibres over synthetics, better for the planet and for your living, breathing skin!
            - A towel
            - Mats are provided but you’re welcome to bring your own

      <div class="accordion-body" markdown="1">
        All of our classes can accommodate beginners. Our experienced teachers offer lots of options and modifications, and you are welcome to take a rest at any time.

        <a class="accordion-toggler js-toggleAccordion">Is it safe to come to the studio if I have any injuries or physical limitations?</a>
      </h5>
      <div class="accordion-body" markdown="1">
        We absolutely encourage you to! We have group classes designed specifically for rehabilitation, and generally offer options and modifications during our classes, just let your teacher know if you have any injuries or health issues that will affect your practice. If you’re still nervous about it, have very specific requirements, or you’d simply like a personalised practice just for you, don’t hesitate to book a private session with one of our 3 senior teachers. A private session pack is the best way to truly take your body to the next level!

      </h5>
      <div class="accordion-body" markdown="1">
        We would love you to do a Taster! A casual class doesn't showcase the extent of what we have to offer; so by all means purchase the introductory pass and try everything

        Don’t worry about it! We will activate your pass on the first scheduled class visit.
