Our Russell Lea sanctuary was the first studio in Australia to be <strong>fully sustainable</strong>. We aspire to have the smallest possible environmental footprint so, from the 100% biodegradable mats to the organic cotton bolsters and straps, to rice husk bricks, to the resin used for the restoration of the flooring, everything has been done to honour the health of you and the Earth.

This studio is the first Australian yoga studio in a restored church. The building dates back to 1942 and is an architectural treasure, providing plenty of space and beautiful light to enhance any practice.
